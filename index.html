    <div class="text-content"><p>Hello Celene! I'm aware I don't write to you a lot, as much as you do to me. I've told you quite a while ago that I'd put up a page where I'd do it. So here it is :)</p>

        <p>We've been talking for a year and it feels weird not having to talk to you like the usual. I'd thought about watching true crime, but it also feels weird not watching it with you. Whoever said: "you pay no mind to that person when they're around, but miss them when they're not" was right.</p>
<p> I hope you're having fun spending the time with your family. When you had your laptop, you'd just give 80% of your attention to me. Silly.</p>
        
<h2>17 June 2022</h2>
        <p> Today, I woke up and went on with my usual routine. Except, I watch over my grandmother for a short time cuz she tends to sleep a lot. I guess it's the medication.</p>
        <p> As my stepdad and my mom smoked outside, they were approached by a cat. It followed them upstairs where our complex is. They let it in the front porch for a while and called me. My mom had told me "there's a cat in our front porch." There is an excitement you can see from her face. She'd always been allergic to cats but I believe she secretly loves them.</p>
        <p> My stepdad on the other hand, he has a great love for cats. He'd talk to them as if they'd understand him. So, I went to the front porch and I was amazed by this cat. It was such an endearing and gentle one. Usually, I'd greet cats but they don't rub their body as much as this one did. It looked hairy and scrawny. I went to get a small bowl of food and fed it. It munched a lot and boy, this cat was starvin' Marvin as if it'd eat his heart out.</p>
        <p> At some point it kept sniffing the porch door so I figured it wanted to go inside. I let him in and he sniffed pretty much every object he'd stumble upon. He went to the room where my grandma is. He stared at her a lot, probably wondering why she hasn't said "hi."</p>
        <p> I introduced him to my grandma in a way like he's a part of the family now. Whenever I picked him up, he'd claw on me like he feels scared or anxious. Then my grandma uttered the words "that's the next door's cat." I felt bad cuz the cat seemed underfed and the tail look bent. It could've been tortured by some stupid kid in another household. In the back of my mind, I  was the same a decade ago. Torturing cats, how sadistic for a youngin huh?</p>
        <p> I put him in Oscar's soft kennel. I forgot to mention I hadn't let him out because I can only imagine how he would act. Maybe he'd freaked out a little bit. So I let him out while this cat is in his kennel, and I wasn't expecting what had happened. The cat aggressively hissed at him and scratched the kennel to an extent. Oscar backed off and I quickly picked him up and brought it back to my room. I talked to him, he barked and whined. Poor doggo.</p>
        <p> From that forth, we were deciding to keep the cat but went to letting him go. I went downstairs and it dashed. I followed and it laid on the side of the building which confused me. If this was the next door neighbor's cat, how come he didn't go straight there. I checked back after a short time and it was still there. I wanted to keep it so bad.</p>
        <p>P.S. the cat looked like Lynx but extra furry.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Also, watched the game today. Celtics lost to Warriors, 103-90 Game 6. Splash Bros plus aggy Draymond are getting their 4th ring. Steph finally made MVP. Spectacular times.</p>

<h2>18 June 2022</h2>
        <p> I know you're starting off work today so I wish you very best of luck. I hope you somehow find the fun in your part-time job. I am very proud of you so you should be proud as well.</p>
        <p>I remember when I had a part-time job, it felt too short. I tutored kids and I had the best time. Besides teaching them my usual nerd stuff, they made me laugh with their nonsense comments.</p>

        <br>
        <p> Also, I had a wonderful chat with my friend today. Remember the one I told you about? The one that shares her trauma and has a sleep paralysis. I call her Emcee/MC. She brought it up and I said I'd probably scream if I had sleep paralysis. She even said "I'd pray for you, Max." Funny. Not funny if that never happens.</p>
        <p> She had an amazing coming-out story to share to me. She came out as asexual. I felt proud because she is finally finding herself and she did that on pride month. She is ready to strut with her asexual stilettos.</p>

        <p> I even told her about you because we had a discussion about BDSM. I also told her it plays a part in our situationship. She is inquiring and wants to be part of the community but as a dom like me. I explained to her that BDSM isn't harmful at it seems. It practices trust, communication, boundaries etc.</p>
        <p> She asked if it's long distance and I said yeah. It works somehow but I look forward to that day it'll be in person. Besides that we can do other things, wink wink.</p>

        <h2>29 June 2022</h2>
        <p>Our firsts and lowkeys</p>
        <br>
        <p>First was a “Celery, this is my friend Max” and a welcoming presence and I lowkey thought you were a white girl.</p>
        <p>First compliment was “who’s Mao? he looks hot” and lowkey hiding it from you that it was me. I must've not been wanting female attention.</p>
         <p>First ever you’ve exposed yourself “Max is Asian?!” with an eye-candy, knowing you lowkey got love for an ethnic group, the Eskimos. Kidding! It’s Asians, God knows why.</p>
         <p>First time bonding and joking around was exposing Dallas, who lowkey thought she had us fooled. I think the fuck not.</p>
         <p>First expression of my personal love language…sharing music. Couldn’t have been a better timing and I lowkey hoped you were familiar with the songs I’ve put. I cherish those days.</p>
         <p>First rant from one of your many was about how shitty your ex-boyfriend at that time was, I lowkey wanted to tell him off myself. Or you know, maybe just “accidentally” run him over.</p>
         <p>First deep conversation involved a therapizing and reading through you. It also involved what you refer to as “forcing me to admit that I like you” and I lowkey felt the same, somehow.</p>
         <p>First time you’d been single since we met, I was lowkey wanting to ghost everybody. Including you. Especially you. Nature, I guess?</p>
         <p>First of sexual things, the role-playing, and the consequent bickering. I lowkey hated you. I felt like your rebound or another go-to guy.</p>
         <p>The first ever “I like you” and immediately you were thrown off, “BRB” you said. Giggling and stomping like you hit the lottery, isn’t it? It wasn’t lowkey at that point. It was so obvious.</p>
            <p>The last of this sentence was the first “I love you.” Approximately a week after the minor accident. Was it the concussion? It’s the dramatic, lowkey feeling that goes “what if I never got to tell her?” The other feeling that involves wanting to run to you and tell you how my day goes. The resentment that I’ve been keeping from the world and my environment. The “dada” jokes…ha-ha. Get it? No? Okay.</p>
         <p>To conclude this stupid, pointless writing I claimed to be “gross” – I’m sure there will be other firsts. Experiences, feelings or set of jokes. In the back of your head, you must’ve visualized it already. Perhaps, less lowkeys. Less secretive and more open version of me.</p>

        <p> P.S. I included this weird, furry GIF. He looks tired as much as I am.</p>
          <h2>12 July 2022</h2>
        <p> Can you believe it's halfway past 2022? Time flies by so fast. Remember I mentioned to you earlier that I was doing a bit of apartment search? In that process, a lot of questions popped up in my head. Such as "would this be spacious enough for us to live in?" I was also thinking in case we move in together.</p>
        <p> I know we haven't met in person for me to come on too strong that way. I was just thinking all of these stuff because a lot can happen in a year. A part of me is very selfish and lonesome but a part of me also includes you in thoughts or life plans.</p>
        <p> Also if that ever happens, we'd be like that couple from Full House K-drama. The couple in that show drove each other crazy but in a funny and romantic way.</p>
