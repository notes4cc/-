        <p>We've been talking for a year and it feels weird not having to talk to you like the usual. I'd thought about watching true crime, but it also feels weird not watching it with you. Whoever said: "you pay no mind to that person when they're around, but miss them when they're not" was right.</p>
<p> I hope you're having fun spending the time with your family. When you had your laptop, you'd just give 80% of your attention to me. Silly.</p>
