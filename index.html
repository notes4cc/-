    <h1 class="text-title">This is my letter and a re-cap to you. An awfully long one.</h1>
    <div class="text-content"><p>It started when we were having a casual and playful conversation. You complained about not liking certain things. I expressed my confusion and inquisition on why do you hate on things that have nothing to do with you. Then you proceeded to include your thoughts based on your experience from that word. Still had nothing to do with you. </p>
        <p>You expressed your dislike, I questioned you. It killed my mood and you had to nerve to convince me into participating to perhaps change your experience. I refused. I admit I overreacted but same parties were responsible for getting into a fight. It blew out of proportion.</p>
<h2>11 June 2022</h2>
<p>You've been sending sappy messages. I still didn't feel the need to reciprocate the same gooey energy. I wasn't feeling it and I was allowed to feel that way, in that moment. You asked for reassurance and I gave you an honest response. I did not feel the need to explain why besides having other priorities right now. I've been caring for my grandmother whose bedridden and she's giving me a hard time. It wasn't enough that I was processing what had happened to her. It's been different levels on how my family and I have been dealing with her. Again, I did not feel the need to explain but here I am. </p>
<h2>12 June 2022</h2>
<p>Midnight – a follow up from that conversation that we left off. I did not give you the response that you wanted. I know I could've said it better. My mind wasn't in the right place to think how would you feel. I rarely do considering the fact that I am selfish, and I'm used to being by myself. </p>
<p>You've stated an obvious on my position in your life then questioned me why I've been toxic. Then you said I was the reason you hurt yourself today. So I withdrew myself and then you invalidated my withdrawal. </p>
<p>You also managed to assume that I had been talking to someone else when I haven't been. Yeah, I did that before but over the time I managed to keep myself from doing it again. I've told you from the moment that I liked you that I open to growth and changes. Even the bare minimum, better than nothing.</p>
<p>You asked for proof and I said "I don't have to prove anything I'm not lying about." I did not like that. I was dead serious and I stand by my defense. You still kept questioning me. I said you have trust issues and you response was "I wonder why." Was I the root of your issues? You've managed to blame me again. Then you brought up what I did in the past. I insisted you to fix yourself and figure things out. It's a good thing.</p>
<p>Also, I admitted to having episodes. You have not been understanding especially this moment. You've blamed me a few times already for things I wasn't responsible for. Let me remind you this – I am not liable to fix the damages done to you. I too, am damaged. </p>
<p>I was still being questioned, on why I acted the way I did. I have no explanation for it. If you don't know by now, I do not have control over my episodes. I am not on medication. Then you resonated that you can also be rude back to me, when I am going through an episode.</p>
<p>I wanted to withdraw from the conversation at that point. You kept texting when I just said you keep initiating a conversation. </p>
<p>Besides that, I expressed that I have set some boundaries and you disrespected it. Again, it's back to me by you saying I am disrespectful overall. Perhaps to you and others, I come off as disrespectful.</p>
<p>You said "I love you" to me and I said I don't. You initiated that I do as if it's your place to speak for me. Then I responded something like: it's hard to love somebody who forces things that shouldn't meant to align together. I meant that. You said you weren't forcing anything but to me it feels like it. Then you ask "how?" How can I keep explaining things over and over? How else I would tell you that it feels invasive to me? Can't you find it within yourself to accept it?</p>
<p>So I made my decision to simply just cut you off. Remove any connections with you. </p>
<p>Another thing...the cherry on top. You threatened me. You said:
    You possessed flashy content like my dick pics
    You would STALK me and dm each of my friends
    And here's one – you're blaming me for the 3RD TIME. This time you're resonating with how I triggered your abandonment issues.</p>
<p>You fucked up, as I told you. Then you managed to turn it on me by saying I am a fuck-up as well. I've been aware of that, Celene..way before we met.</p>
<p>You're mad over me telling you that you're not important. I responded with "this is worse than my situation with my ex."</p>
<p>She did not threaten me when we officially ended our relationship and our FWB relationship. But you did. </p>
<p>And then you said "she didn't even like you."</p>
<p>How could you assume the situation or how my ex felt on her past relationship with me? I never would've expected you to stoop that low.</p>
<p>Lastly, you blamed me again. For the fucking 4th time. </p>
<p>"You make me act like this."</p>
<p>I blocked you. That concludes how things went down.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Celene, you haven't given me any reason to include you in the people that I don't feel the need for in my life. Or the people I need to cut off connections with.</p>
<p>But I cannot let this one slide. This time I an validating it. I am once again initiating you to truly find yourself. Without relying on your romantic interest or anybody. Trust and encourage yourself.</p>
<p>I too, have a lot to work on myself. Not assuring you enough is something I can work on, by meeting new/different people and going through new experiences. </p>
<p>I will not choose to go through ANOTHER predicament with somebody that needs fixing. That is you, Celene.</p>
<p>I have to work on my mental health without hurting others. I've hurt you, the damage is done and I cannot repair it. I owe the time to work on myself and so should you. </p>
<p>I wish you courage, to find peace in yourself and other things, and the strength to face each day.</p>
<p>I've said everything.</p>
<p>I hope I never forget you so farewell.</p>
