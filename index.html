        <p>We've been talking for a year and it feels weird not having to talk to you like the usual. I'd thought about watching true crime, but it also feels weird not watching it with you. Whoever said: "you pay no mind to that person when they're around, but miss them when they're not" was right.</p>
<p> I hope you're having fun spending the time with your family. When you had your laptop, you'd just give 80% of your attention to me. Silly.</p>
        
<h2>17 June 2022</h2>
        <p> Today, I woke up and went on with my usual routine. Except, I watch over my grandmother for a short time cuz she tends to sleep a lot. I guess it's the medication.</p>
        <p> As my stepdad and my mom smoked outside, they were approached by a cat. It followed them upstairs where our complex is. They let it in the front porch for a while and called me. My mom had told me "there's a cat in our front porch." There is an excitement you can see from her face. She'd always been allergic to cats but I believe she secretly loves them.</p>
        <p> My stepdad on the other hand, he has a great love for cats. He'd talk to them as if they'd understand him. So, I went to the front porch and I was amazed by this cat. It was such an endearing and gentle one. Usually, I'd greet cats but they don't rub their body as much as this one did. It looked hairy and scrawny. I went to get a small bowl of food and fed it. It munched a lot and boy, this cat was starvin' Marvin as if it'd eat his heart out.</p>
        <p> At some point it kept sniffing the porch door so I figured it wanted to go inside. I let him in and he sniffed pretty much every object he'd stumble upon. He went to the room where my grandma is. He stared at her a lot, probably wondering why she hasn't said "hi."</p>
        <p> I introduced him to my grandma in a way like he's a part of the family now. Whenever I picked him up, he'd claw on me like he feels scared or anxious. Then my grandma uttered the words "that's the next door's cat." I felt bad cuz the cat seemed underfed and the tail look bent. It could've been tortured by some stupid kid in another household. In the back of my mind, I  was the same a decade ago. Torturing cats, how sadistic for a youngin huh?</p>
        <p> I put him in Oscar's soft kennel. I forgot to mention I hadn't let him out because I can only imagine how he would act. Maybe he'd freaked out a little bit. So I let him out while this cat is in his kennel, and I wasn't expecting what had happened. The cat aggressively hissed at him and scratched the kennel to an extent. Oscar backed off and I quickly picked him up and brought it back to my room. I talked to him, he barked and whined. Poor doggo.</p>
        <p> From that forth, we were deciding to keep the cat but went to letting him go. I went downstairs and it dashed. I followed and it laid on the side of the building which confused me. If this was the next door neighbor's cat, how come he didn't go straight there. I checked back after a short time and it was still there. I wanted to keep it so bad.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Also, watched the game today. Celtics lost to Warriors, 103-90 Game 6. Steph and Klay plus aggy Draymond are getting their 4th ring. Spectacular times.</p>
